# Ethernaut Challenges - OpenZeppelin  

This repository was created to  solve the challenges from **[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)**, the smart contract hacking game developed by OpenZeppelin.  

## Technologies Used  
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) – a fast and efficient framework for Solidity development, testing, and deployment.  

## Project Structure  
- `src/` → contracts and challenge solutions  
- `test/` → Foundry tests to validate the solutions  
- `scripts/` → helper scripts for deployment and interactions  

## How to Run  
1. Install Foundry:  
   
2. Install Dependecies:
 ``` forge install ```

## Purpose

This repository serves as study material and practice for Smart Contract Security through the Ethernaut challenges.
